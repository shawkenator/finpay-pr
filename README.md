## Application overview
This application is a 'user management' tool, which is a basic CRUD React/Redux app which has a primary UI consisting of a list of `User` objects. The user object shape is defined in the `User.ts` file, as a typescript interface.

There are a few issues with this application - the goal will be to figure out what is wrong with it and how we can best improve it.

# Instructions

## Look for mistakes

Note any sections of the application which you believe need improvement. This can include the visual look and feel, the way that the interface works, ways that the user experience can be improved, and of course the code itself.

## Think of solutions

Now that you have a list of problems from the previous step, think of how you would resolve or improve the issues you've encountered. For issues such as logic bugs or coding style it may be helpful to write down a solution or at least have an idea of what steps you would take to resolve the problem. For issues with the look and feel, you can point out where the source of the issue is and note how it could be improved.

## Look for parts that are good 'as-is'

If there are any parts of the application that you feel are well-designed, and don't need to be touched, you may keep those in mind too.
